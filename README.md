# PID-controller_metamorphic-testing
In this project we are gonna test pid-controllers with specific testing approach called metamorphic-testing.<br>

---
**TCLab Note:**
we have inserted some extra code to TCLab library so that we have more flexibility to create new PID-controller.
the new library has been located alongside with 'alltogather' directory so you can use that.
<br>
the modified directory which is located in alltogather directory, contains new version of each implementation So that none of them has MR2.
